     * Create an Asset Report

     * The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. The exact amount of time to create the report will vary depending on how many days of history are requested and will typically range from a few seconds to about one minute. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).

     * By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report. To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

     * For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call `/asset_report/create` with `options.add_ons` set to `["fast_assets"]`.

     * Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id.

     *
     * The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.
     *
     * Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).
     *
     * Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.
     *
     * Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.
     *
     * Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks.

If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected.

     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED`: This is the initial state of all payments. It indicates that the payment is waiting on user input to continue processing. A payment may re-enter this state later on if further input is needed.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`: The payment has been successfully authorised and accepted by the financial institution. For successful payments, this is a potential terminal status. Further status transitions can be to REJECTED and, when supported by the institution, to EXECUTED.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`: The payment has failed due to insufficient funds.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED`: The payment has failed to be initiated. This error may be caused by transient system outages and is retryable once the root cause is resolved.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED`: The payment has been blocked by Plaid. This can occur, for example, due to Plaid flagging the payment as potentially risky. This is a retryable error.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING`: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when the financial institution has authorised the transaction.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED`: The payment was cancelled (typically by the end user) during authorisation.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED`: The funds have successfully left the payer account and payment is considered complete. Not all institutions support this status: support is more common in the UK, and less common in the EU. For institutions where this status is not supported, the terminal status for a successful payment will be `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`.
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED`: The payment has settled and funds are available for use. A payment will typically settle within seconds to several days, depending on which payment rail is used. This status is only available to customers using [Plaid Virtual Accounts](https://plaid.com/docs/virtual-accounts/).
     *
     * `PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.

An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.

   *
   * The response to `/asset_report/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id`  is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

   * @description By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

   * To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.
   *
   * Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

   * Get transaction data
   * @description Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.
   *
   * The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.
   *
   * Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).
   *
   * Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.
   *
   * Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.
   *
   * Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

  /**
   * Get incremental transaction updates on an Item
   * @description The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.
   *
   * `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).
   *
   * This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.
   *
   * Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.
   *
   * In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.
   *
   * Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.
   *
   * When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.
   *
   * Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.
   *
   * For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.
   *
   * To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.
   *
   * `/transactions/sync` does not directly return balance data. To get the balance for an account, call `/accounts/get`, which is a free-to-use endpoint that will return the cached balance as of the last successful transactions update.

   * Get transaction data
   * @description The `/processor/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.
   *
   * Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).
   *
   * Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.
   *
   * Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.
   *
   * Note that data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/processor/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. If no transaction history is ready when `/processor/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.
   *
   * To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processors/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

   * In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.
   *
   * Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.
   *
   * When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.
   *
   * Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.
   *
   * Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the corresponding Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.
   *
   * To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processors/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

   * Refresh transaction data
   * @description `/processor/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and `/processor/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) and will result in a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on a processor token from that institution.

To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`.

Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.

   * Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

   * There are three possible outcomes to calling this endpoint: If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer. If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`. If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.
   *
   * In Plaid's Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:
   *
   *   - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.
   *
   *   - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).
   *
   *   - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).
   *
   *   - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.
   *
   *   - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.
