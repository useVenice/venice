title: Deploy to Vercel
description: Easily deploy Venice to the cloud
---

While implementing your new Venice pipeline, you'll want to run Venice either [locally](/technical/deploy-locally)
or to the cloud.

Thankfully the process is straightforward:

1. One-click deploy using [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Add environment variables (e.g. API key, database credentials, JWT secret)
3. Test your integration & push any changes
4. Open a pull request back into Venice's GitHub repo

## Quickstart

### One click deploy with Vercel

Using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), your instance of Venice will be up and running
in just a few minutes. See [Environment variables](/technical/deploy-to-cloud#environment-variables)
for more information on the expected environment keys and values.

</a>

1. Click the `Deploy` button above
2. Create a repository on Vercel
3. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
4. On Supabase, go to `Settings` > `Database` and scroll down to `Connection String` and click `URI`
5. Copy that link and insert it as your `POSTGRES_OR_WEBHOOK_URL` in Vercel — remember to add your password to the URL when you paste it into Vercel
6. On Supabase, Go to `Settings` > `API` and scroll down to get your JWT token. Copy this and paste it into Vercel
7. Go to [Plaid](https://plaid.com) > `Team Settings` > `Keys` and copy the `Plaid ID` and `Sandbox Secret` key into Vercel
8. Deploy Vercel
9. Once Vercel is ready, click to open the domain it deployed to
10. Create a test account & login
11. Click `Add` next to `Connections` to test your new integration
12. Visit the database or table in Supabase to see the data

### Hook up to a test database (e.g. Supabase)

Here's a quick video from our founder on how to hook Venice up to a custom
database in just a few minutes using [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

## Environment variables

During the deployment process, you'll notice Venice relies upon a few environment
variables to configure itself. Most of these are optional and have sensible defaults
to fall back on, but feel free to customize any you wish.

These environment variables are also found within the [.env.example](https://github.com/useVenice/venice/blob/main/.env.example)
file you can use to deploy Venice locally to your machine.

## Environments

There are three environments Venice operates in when creating new connections,
and they correspond to the same environments in data aggregators like Plaid.

- **sandbox**: access to test data only (e.g. `Platypus` bank using `user_good` & `pass_good` credentials)
- **development**: limited access to live data
- **production**: access to live financial data

The default is `sandbox`. To change the environment when creating new connections,
append `&env=development` (or `&env=production`) to the end of the add pipeline URL.

This setting only affects new connections. Existing connections store which
environment they are part of and automatically use the correct environment-specific
keys from environment variables when communicating with data aggregators.
