description: Easily test your new integrations by running Venice locally
---

While implementing your new Venice pipeline, you may want to run locally or 
[deploy to cloud](/technical/deploy-to-cloud) to test your changes.

Note: we welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/usevenice/venice)!

## Localhost Quickstart

1. Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:usevenice/venice.git`

2. Make a copy of the [.env.example](https://github.com/useVenice/venice/blob/main/.env.example) file named `.env`

3. Populate your environment keys:

If you have an existing [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) setup, you can pull your environment keys using:

```bash
vercel env pull --environment production .env.prod
```

Otherwise, please see [deploy to cloud](/technical/deploy-to-cloud#environment-variables) for more information on the environment keys and expected values.

4. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) & [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and then run:

```bash
nvm use 18 # Optional, we recommend node 18.x

pnpm preinstall
pnpm install
pnpm run web
```

Note: if you need to run database migrations, you can use:

```bash
pnpm run migration up # (optional) we support Postgres for now, but feel free to extend Venice and add more
```

5. Visit http://localhost:3000

### Pro Tips

- Use [shdotenv](https://github.com/ko1nksm/shdotenv) to load env vars from `.env` files

```bash
shdotenv -e .env.prod pnpm run web
```
