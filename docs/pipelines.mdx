title: Add pipelines
description: Easily create new data pipelines into and out of Venice 
---

Zero to production in 5 minutes without a single line of code:

1. Add environment variables (Plaid API key, database credentials, JWT secret).
2. Embed pre-built UI with user-scoped `accessToken`.
3. Voila! Query data in your database.

## Quick start

## Why we exist

We built Venice after working on multiple fintech products. Despite the explosion of amazing fintech services like Plaid, setting up a stack still takes a ton of work. Writing integration code, UI to help user manage their connections, maintaining uptime, running data pipelines, and building the company proved to be a lot to handle. There are a ton of undifferentated plumbing here and we think we can build it once as a community and not have everyone re-invent the wheel. That way fintech developers can do what they do best — build fintech, not ETL pipelines!

## Architecture

Venice scales up and down based on your needs. Get started with no-code, call API when the need arises, or get your hands dirty in source code with your custom fork.

Venice is designed to be modular and extensible. Drop down to the level of abstraction that best fits your need.

## Getting started

1. Click the "Deploy to Vercel" link.
2. Create a repository on Vercel.
3. Go to Supabase.com and create a new project.
4. On Supabase, go to Settings > Database and scroll down to "Connection String" and click "URI".
5. Copy that link and insert it as your `POSTGRES_OR_WEBHOOK_URL` in Vercel — remember to add your password to the URL when you paste it into Vercel.
6. On Supabase, Go to Settings > API and scroll down to get your JWT token. Copy this and paste it into Vercel.
7. Go to Plaid > Team Settings > Keys and copy the Plaid ID and Sandbox Secret key into Vercel.
8. Deploy Vercel.
9. Once Vercel is ready, click to open the domain.
10. Go to jwt.io, enter the same JWT token here as you saw in Supabase. Copy this access token.
11. Paste the access token into the URL of the Vercel Domain and add the words `?accessToken=$YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
12. Voila! You should see your page. Click new connection and connect using Plaid Link. Visit the database or table in Supabase to see the transactions and accounts!

## Non-sandbox environment

There are three environments venice operates in when creating new connections, and they correspond to the same envs in Plaid.

- sandbox
- development
- production

The default is `sandbox`. To change the environment when creating new connections, append `&env=development|production` to the end of the url (where you normally add access token).

This setting only affects new connections. Existing connections store which environment they are part of and automatically use the correct environment-specific keys from environment variables when communicating with Plaid.

## Environment variables

## Local Development

1. Clone repo `git clone git@github.com:usevenice/venice.git`.

2. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and populate your own values.

3. Install dependencies and run:

```bash
nvm use 16 # Optional, we recommend node 16.x

pnpm install
pnpm run migration up # Other databases such as Mongo / Redis / Firebase will be supported later. Let us know if you would like to contribute
pnpm run dev
```

4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`.

Couple things you can try:

- Connect via first selecting institution vs. connecting via selecting provider.
- Venice works fully as a CLI tool as well.

```bash
# Sync a connection
pnpm run venice syncConnection --id $connectionId

# Sync pipeline
pnpm run venice syncPipeline --source.id $connectionId --destination.id conn_fs --destination.settings.basePath ./data

# Sync pipeline by fully specifying all source & destination settings
pnpm run venice syncPipeline --source.id conn_plaid --source.settings.accessToken $accessToken --destination.id conn_fs --destination.settings.basePath ./data
```

Tips

- Use [`shdotenv`](https://github.com/ko1nksm/shdotenv) to load env vars from .env files

## FAQs

Why is it called Venice?

> First to pay homage to Venice as the birth place of modern accounting. Second, the Venetian canals were used to transport goods, much like useVenice pipelines are used to transport financial data.
