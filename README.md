## What is Venice?

**Venice is the backend for finance.** Build the next Mint.com in a weekend. With raw 
access to Venice's financial database, you can easily integrate rich 
financial data into your apps, giving you back months of time to focus on de-risking 
your startup & building user-friendly interfaces and features.

Venice works great whether you have years of coding experience or you're using
no-code platforms (Bubble, Glide, Retool) to build the next billion dollar company
or internal team tool. 

> Simple things should be simple, but complex things should be possible.

Never want to touch code? We support that. Want to dive deep into SQL or add a
custom pipeline into or out of Venice? We also support (& encourage) that!

Let us handle the hard data engineering & complexity of sync pipelines across 
thousands of financial institutions and data sources. We're here to give you &
your customers superpowers and make manual data entry a thing of the past. Your 
customer's data will always be unified, standardized, and up-to-date.

Here's what others are building with Venice:
- Personal finance apps (build your own Mint.com in a weekend!)
- Internal team dashboards using Mode or Redash
- Internal apps using no-code platforms like Retool
- Financial reports using custom Python scripts
- Internal team expense & forecasting apps
- Continuously updated spreadsheets (your data, your way!)

## Who is Venice for?

You, probably. Venice supports a large variety of use cases, whether you're a data analyst, engineer, no-code dev, finance geek (like us), data scientist, accountant, small business owner, etc... we're here to help you get your data from A to B in a simple, unified way.

## Custom integrations

Venice already supports thousands of financial institutions (banks, investment 
accounts, etc.) out-of-the-box, but our platform's flexibility doesn't end there.

Venice can help build custom integrations to either pipe data into Venice 
from a data source of your choosing or pipe data out of Venice into any tool or API you want. 
This allows you to easily integrate your existing data sources with Venice and 
make use of Venice's unified and standardized data engineering & infrastructure.

Your can request custom integration pipelines by contacting [Venice's support 
team](mailto:hi@venice.is) and providing information about the data source you 
want access to. Venice's team will then work with you to build a custom integration 
pipeline to suit your needs.

Custom integration pipelines can be set up for specific data sources such as 
accounting software, banking data, or payment gateways, and can be scheduled to 
run at specific intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly.

We're on your team, so you can relax and do what you love best while we handle all the
hard stuff.

### Examples

- Importing from accounting software (Quickbooks, Xero, etc)
- Exporting to your own SQL database or data lake / warehouse
- Importing from payments providers (Stripe, Paypal, etc.)
- Importing from commerce software (Shopify) 
- Exporting to financial planning / modeling software (Runway.com)

## How do I contribute?

Jump into our [documentation](https://docs.venice.is) and learn how you can easily extend Venice to add new financial data pipelines into and out of Venice.

## Looking for self-hosting?

The current Venice `main` branch is focused on the Venice platform. The previous version
focused on self-hosting can be found at the [self-hosting](https://github.com/useVenice/venice/tree/self-hosting) branch.
Our goal is to bridge the gap (for specifically for the cloud platform to depend on self-hosting under the hood) and merge the codepath 
so there is only a single branch. Ping us on Discord if you would like details.
